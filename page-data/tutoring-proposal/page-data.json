Should we try for this week? We could trade-out some office hours if we wanted to run with it.</li>\n<li>@KrisJordan: We'll need to flesh out a communication strategy with a little more depth. Here are the key questions students should be able to answer with what we communicate:\nA) Which tutoring hours are right for me for me to attend? (From our perspective, we need to communicate the two different classifications of tutoring well without it feeling alienating to the majority who are served primarily by the less-experienced hours.)\nB) How do I know when one of my house TAs is tutoring? (We can use Postem for sharing this info. Ideally it's somewhat constant.)\nC) Will we just post these hours to Course.Care with general labels?</li>\n<li>@KrisJordan: How should we track and quantify attendance / use of resource to be sure this is a valuable complement to office hours?</li>\n</ol>","headings":[{"depth":2,"value":"Purpose"},{"depth":2,"value":"Overview"},{"depth":2,"value":"Scheduling"},{"depth":2,"value":"Open Questions to Address in this Proposal"}],"frontmatter":{"date":"September 01, 2020","slug":"/tutoring-proposal","title":"Tutoring Proposal","author":["Izzy Ford '21","Lizzie Abouchar '21"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tutoring-proposal"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1947816842"]}
